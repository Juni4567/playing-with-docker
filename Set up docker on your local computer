1. download nginex stable version with alpine
2. run the following command if you are running it for the first time:
	docker run --name juni-nginx -d -v c:/Users/junai/Desktop/wp_docker/juni-docker:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro -p 80:80 nginx:1.12.2-alpine

	-- If you have already ran this command then pls check if it's running as deamon process because if it's running you can't run it again you'll get an error
		docker ps (to check if the process is alraedy running) It'll show something like folowing if it's already running 

		$ docker ps
		CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                 COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                NAMES
		2e59f77edc62        nginx:1.12.2-alpine   "nginx -g 'daemon ofâ€¦"   2 minutes ago       Up 2 minutes        0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp   juni-nginx

	-- If the process is already running then you must run these two commands:
		-- docker stop juni-nginx
		-- docker rm juni-nginx
		-- Now you are able to run the docker run command again with the same juni-nginx name


3. Note that you cannot use file paths like mac e.g. If you type pwd in windows command prompt you'll get something like : "c/Users/junai/Desktop/wp_docker/juni-docker" but you need to pass "c:/Users/junai/Desktop/wp_docker/juni-docker" to have it work
	-- If you pass the first path then you'll get the container running and also it'll create a volume folder for you names something like "juni-docker;C" which does not work even if you change your files in it

	
Docker volume in windows 10 working great

4. Commands used that must be remebered

	1. Create the docker image
		docker run --name juni-nginx -d -v c:/Users/junai/Desktop/wp_docker/juni-docker:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro -p 80:80 nginx:1.12.2-alpine

	2. stop running docker image
		docker stop juni-nginx

	3. remove docker image so that you can re-create it or change the settings (the docker ps for the image must not be running)
		docker rm juni-nginx

	4. Go inside the container and access the files
		winpty docker exec -ti juni-nginx ./bin/sh

	5. to see running docker images "docker ps" and to see all docker images that were ever ran "docker ps -a"

	6. To see a list of pulled images from the docker hub "docker image ls"

	7. "ll" or "ls" or "dir" lists all the files in current directory


5. IMPORTANT: Keep in mind that when using docker on windows, when you mount a directory to a container you are asked to allow permission to the windows file system and you must enter your user/password to allow that. windows will prompt you when you link a folder to your docker container as volume
